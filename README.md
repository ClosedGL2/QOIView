# QOIView

A simple image viewer that supports the [Quite OK Image Format](https://qoiformat.org/) using my own implementation of a QOI encoder/decoder

Forked from [Baitinq's OSXIV](https://github.com/Baitinq/OSXIV)

## Usage

```
./qoiview path_to_img
```

## Compilation

1. Install the SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries
2. ```make```

## Why?

SXIV is bloated, and I wanted to try out the QOI format
